                        <h3>Team History</h3>
                        <p>In 1997, Arthur Lee and the Nexus Group successfully lobbied for an expansion
                            team to establish home in Las Vegas. The following season, the Las Vegas
                            Dealers played their first game at MGM arena. In its inaugural season, Las
                            Vegas and the NBA saw the birth of a bright young talent in Kobe Bryant, who
                            turned out to be the biggest prize the Dealers franchise would have drafted for
                            the next decade. With their superstar, the Dealers enjoyed early success that
                            were often elusive for expansion teams. During his sixteen years tenure in Las
                            Vegas, Bryant led the Dealers to nine division titles, eleven playoff appearances
                            and three championships.</p>
                        <p>Before the 2008 season, majority owner Arthur Lee announced his retirement
                            and requested to have the Dealers relocate to Hawaii, where Lee will continue to
                            be involved with the team post-retirement. In 2010, the Dealers was relocated to
                            Hawaii, and officially changed its name to the Surfriders. The transition however
                            was not exactly smooth for the team. A slew of injuries including that of Kobe
                            Bryant devastated the Surfriders’ season that year. The lost season resulted in a
                            lottery opportunity for the Surfriders. In this draft, there was an incredible
                            prospect by the name of Lebron James, who the Surfriders aggressively traded
                            up to draft.</p>
                        <p>The Surfriders quickly returned to championship contention with the healthy
                            Bryant and the arrival of James. Following multiple years of consecutive playoff
                            runs, the Surfriders captured the franchise’s third championship in 2018, but also
                            bid farewell to its franchise star Bryant, who retired on top following the
                            conclusion of the season.</p>
